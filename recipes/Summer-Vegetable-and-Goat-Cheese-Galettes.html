    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Easy and pretty vegetable tarts that can be prepared a few hours ahead of

    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped green onions</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (5 ounce) creamy goat cheese log</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>½ pound zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ pound roma tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and
        stir green onions in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Add
        garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine goat cheese, Parmesan cheese, and cayenne pepper in a small
        bowl; stir with a fork until blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently flatten each puff pastry sheet with a rolling pin on a lightly
        floured surface. Cut each sheet into four squares. Lightly cut a border
        about 1/4-inch from the edges of each square using a sharp knife, not
        going all the way through the dough.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Arrange puff pastry squares on a baking sheet; spread goat cheese
        mixture on each square. Top each square with onion mixture. Chill in
        refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange zucchini and tomato slices in a pattern on each puff pastry
        square, allowing vegetables to overlap. Season with salt and black
        pepper. Drizzle with about 1 teaspoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until puff pastry is golden brown and puffed,
        about 20 minutes. Garnish with basil strips.
      </li>
    </ol>
